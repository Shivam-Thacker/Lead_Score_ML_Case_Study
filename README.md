Project Overview:
The goal was to build a logistic regression model assigning lead scores (0-100) to prioritize potential leads. The final model achieved:

Training Accuracy: 85%
Test Accuracy: 83%
ROC-AUC Score: 0.93

Key features included lead origins, activities, and user engagement metrics. Recommendations focused on improving lead conversion through targeted strategies and enhanced user interaction.
